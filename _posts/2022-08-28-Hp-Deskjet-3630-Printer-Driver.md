Hello, @Lucky38i - Hope you are well üôÇThanks for stopping by the HP Support Forums! I'd like to help!First off, there is no physical button to reset this printer model. Hence if you need to restore the printer you need to press and hold the Wireless button ( ) and the Cancel button (X) from the printer control panel together for three seconds. Once done, reconnect the printer to the network and check.Also, did you try using a different browser to access the printer EWS? If not, try using a different browser and check.If the issue persists, then as a workaround, try accessing the printer EWS using the Wi-Fi direct IP address. Wi-Fi Direct provides a direct wireless connection to your HP printer that allows you to print without joining a local network or connecting to the Internet.Press the Information button to print a report that includes the Wi-Fi Direct name and password.If the printer does not have an Information button, press and hold the Resume button for 2 seconds to print a report that includes the Wi-Fi Direct name and password.Ideally, the HP Wi-Fi Direct IP address would be¬†192.168.223.1.

Built for home and small office use, the HP DeskJet 3630 printer comes with a small footprint, modern design, wireless connectivity, and an affordable price tag. This printer isn‚Äôt suitable for bulk printing, as the commercial ink cartridges do cost more than competing models. HP offers an Instant Ink solution with prices based on the print volumes you use every month. Although this is an option for small offices, if your usage remains consistent, there‚Äôs not a great amount of savings available even with an Instant Ink subscription.
