Unplug the other end of the cord from the power source.3. If there is a power module on the power cord, disconnect one end and reconnect it.4. After 60 seconds, plug the cord directly into a wall outlet (not a surge protector or battery backup as they can cause the printer to lose basic functionality over time).5.

My Printer model is HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545.¬†I had a HP deskjet 3540 series software installed. I was able to install , scan without any issues. It stopped working. Not sure when this stopped working. When i googled to figure out, I was asked to install HP Smart. I installed it. When i launched, it was showing the printer, but with status unknown. When i client the printer status, nothing is displayed. When i client printer information , i get the details as printer installed. Refer the screen shots attached. Basically, the newly installed HP Smart is having issues. I'm not able to print or scan. I can see a USB port added. When i select and print, i was able to print. Anything through HPSmartPrintingPort is not working. Any help to resolve this issue would be appreciated.¬†Note: I have already tried to uninstall, re-install HP Smart. Issue still exists.
With the HP ePrint app, you can even print even when you are at a far away location, given that the printer has a paper in it. The disadvantage of this printer is that it faces a serious paper jamming problem. Moreover, the photo print quality isn‚Äôt on par with what you would expect from an HP printer. But, aside from this, HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 is no doubt an excellent printer. Download HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 e-All-in-One Printer driver from HP website

1) Install it using its full feature driver.
2) Install it using its basic driver (with installer)
3) Install it using its IMF driver (without installer) you‚Äôll have to install it manually. Here‚Äôs the guide to install it manually.
All three drivers are given in the download section above.

To install the hp driver the same way as installing other applications, the way is easy enough just follow the instructions that exist when the driver is installed to the computer. Each display for the driver install menu is different because it is adjusted to the function of the device, so when installing the driver it is mandatory to read the guide before clicking next/install.
I've got it working before, but after I change my WiFi to Humax (from my ISP) I couldn't get my printer connected.All other devices (iPhone, Desktop, iPad) are connected normally.I tried restore factory settings and still I just said my password is wrong.Anyway to fix, I'm sure my password is correct.

It sounds like the password being entered is different from the network password. If the above directions did not confirm the password information, contact your internet provider or whoever provided you with the router and ask them to verify the network password. While they are doing that, just in case, ask them to disable the Guest network and make sure the router is broadcasting a 2.4GHz (Giga-Hertz) band.Please let me know the results after following the above.
