Hi @pingvin66666,Thank you for joining HP Forums. This is a great place to get support, find answers I understand that your that the cartridge is not working and lights were blinking
No worries, I'll be glad to help you, that said, I'll need a few more details to dissect your concern & provide an accurate solution: Are you using genuine HP ink cartridge?I suggest you do a Hard Reset(1) Turn the printer on, if it is not already on.
(2) Wait until the printer is idle and silent before you continue.
(3) With the printer turned on, disconnect the power cord from the rear of the printer.
(4) Unplug the power cord from the wall outlet.
(5) Wait at least 60 seconds.
(6) Plug the power cord back into the wall outlet.
NOTE: HP recommends connecting the printer power cord directly to the wall outlet.
(7) Reconnect the power cord to the rear of the printer.
(8) Turn on the printer, if it does not automatically turn on.
The printer might go through a warm-up period. The printer lights might flash, and the carriage might move.
Wait until the warm-up period finishes and your printer is idle and silent before you proceed.If the issue persists, click here for further assistance.Do get back to me as I have a few more tricks up my sleeve. Said that, if I have helped you resolve the issue.

Hello MKaziThank your very much for your reply.I've checked and cleaned the contacts on the printer and on the cartridge too. I think I was able to reset the printer with the method that you've sent to me, however the blinking light problem still persists.My seventh sense tells me that the new cartridge is the cause of my problem, but in 1 or 2 months I'll be able to get another genuine cartridge to test the printer again.Until then I must pause my experiments for a few weeks.Thank you for your help!
Hello JergusThis is the original pm that I received back then:"Below mentioned are the steps to reset the printer:Unplug the power cord from the unit.Reconnect the power cord into the unit.When the lights begin to flash, press and hold the Power and Cancel buttons.When only the On/Resume light is flashing, release the buttons.When the On/Resume light is steady, the reset is completeIf the issue persists then you may contact out HP phone support team to seek the replacement options of the ink cartridges. The original Ink cartridges come with a warranty. A firmware update is currently unavailable for this HP printer.All the best! "I hope it helps.

Hello Raj1788Thank you for your reply.I've already tried this method, but the problem still persists. I checked the page about blinking lights when I tried to solve the problem on my own, but it did not helped me at all. Is there any button combination to stop the blinking "Check cartridge" light?
