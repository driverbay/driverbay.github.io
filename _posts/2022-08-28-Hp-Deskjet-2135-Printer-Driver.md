## The hp deskjet 2135 printer driver is a software program that allows users to print documents from a computer.

HP printer driver is an application software program that works on a computer to communicate with a printer. When a print command from a computer is sent to the printer, “Printer Driver” acts like an intermediary and converts information from this program into a language format that can be understood by the printer and operating system that is used on certain computers such as Windows XP, 7, Windows 10. This is important enough to use suitable drivers to avoid problems when printing.
