If the document prints on plain white paper, but not a special paper type, there is no need to continue troubleshooting. The problem is probably related to the paper that you were trying to print on, or possibly a connectivity problem. Review the 'Cause' and 'Experiencing frequent or recurring paper feed issues?’ sections at the beginning of this document to check other possibilities.
Driver conflicting: If you have duplicate drivers for the same device installed on your computer, then you are inviting a risk of driver conflict. Therefore, you should uninstall the old version of your printer driver from your computer before installing your newly downloaded driver.
If the paper only feeds through the printer when you slowly push it farther in, repeat the previous steps to clean the rollers again. If the issue continues after repeated cleaning, skip the next solution in this document, and then service the printer.
Update drivers: When printer manufacturers find bugs in their drivers, they come-up with their latest version to remove those bugs. For this reason, you should always install the latest version of your printer driver on your computer so that you can ensure stable performance of your printing device.

If the test page does not print, try printing the report again. Listen for the rubber paper-pick rollers; you should be able to hear them rotating. Then, try slowly pushing the paper farther in until the roller engages to pick up the paper. Be careful not to push the paper in too far, which can cause paper jams.
After the paper is loaded, click OK on the computer screen, or any button on the printer except the Cancel () button to continue printing. To cancel the print job, click Cancel Print on the computer screen or press the Cancel () button on the control panel.
