## Download and install the brother hl2170w driver.

I appreciate these suggestions. I have dowloaded the most recent drivers available and and reset the printer. When I try to download a generic I get sent to the brother site which says that my printer is not supported. I can't find a place to simply download a generic...it always asks for the model and then says it is not supported.

The Brother web site has a download of a driver for your printer that works with Catalina. Have you tried using it to see if it will work with Big Sur? If it does not, then ask Brother when they will be releasing an update that works with Big Sur. In the alternative, does your printer have Air Print capability? If so, use that and remove any current drivers you have installed. Finally, you can visit the site at the link below where volunteers have written drivers for a lot of printers which are no longer supported. You may find one there which works.
Once users have checked and confirmed that their operating systems are compatible, they can go ahead and start the download process by clicking on the download link. The download process will start immediately with the drivers being stored on the computer hard disk. From here, users can go ahead and install these drivers by opening the file containing the drivers and clicking on the Setup exe format. The file is usually stored in an executable format and once users click on the exe format, the drivers will immediately be installed into the program list. If there is an error with the installation process, check the compatibility of the operating system, uninstall the drivers and re-install them again.
If there ends up being not solution for this, consider using a Virtual Machine(VM) for running Windows (Windows-in-a-window). You would open items in it, and use Windows-only compatible software on it. All would be accessed and would operate as desired on the VM. Virtual Machine applications include VMWare Fusionand Parallels. Learn more here: What Is a Virtual Machine? - VMWare Support.

Click the gray "Submit" button at the bottom of the screen when you are done.

Having the drivers installed is really only step one.

The driver usually downloads into your computer's "Downloads" folder, and you'll need to open it and move it to the "Printers" folder.
