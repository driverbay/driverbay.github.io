## Brother printer driver is a windows application that lets you print from your computer.

A device driver is a piece of software designed to help your machine communicate with your mobile device or computer. Brother drivers allow your Brother printer, label maker, or sewing machine to talk directly with your device. This allows the machinery to understand data sent from a device (such as a picture you want to print or a document you want to scan), and perform the necessary actions. Think of your Brother printer driver as the translator who helps your technology to communicate more effectively.
