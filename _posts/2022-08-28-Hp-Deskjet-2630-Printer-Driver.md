If a printer driver is not installed on your computer, or if it‚Äôs improperly installed, then your computer won‚Äôt be able to detect the printer or complete even the simplest printing tasks. Whenever you buy a new printer, you‚Äôll have to install that printer‚Äôs driver on every computer that you wish to print from.
It is also important to check the compatibility of the driver with the specific version of your operating system. For example, if you have a Mac running Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11, you should install a driver that is compatible with this version of the operating system or higher versions.
As you may or may not know, you can‚Äôt just plug a new printer into your computer and expect it to start printing within seconds. First, you‚Äôve got to install software that‚Äôll enable your computer to work with that printer. That‚Äôs why a lot of people are hesitant about buying a new printer: they don‚Äôt want to deal with all the hassle of installing new software.
