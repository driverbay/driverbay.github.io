Hi @js688,Thanks for stopping by the HP community. A very good day to you. I reviewed the post regarding assistance with the printing issues. Superb description and stupendous diagnosis of the issue before posting. Kudos to you for that. For better clarity and to assist you better I would require more information regarding this:Did this a happen after a recent software or Windows update?For now, let me keep you posted about a few things here. The printer works perfectly as it works correctly on a different computer.This means there is an issue with the operating system of the computer.So please try a clean uninstallation and reinstallation of the printer drivers by following these steps:Uninstall the printer from "programs and features" which can be accessed by doing a right-click on the Windows button (Please have the printer Off and disconnected during uninstallation.)Check in device manager, if the printer is listed there, please delete it. (Right click on the Windows button to access device manager)Go to devices and printers, select any printer listed there and you will get some options on the top. Click on print server properties. You will get a popup, click on the drivers tab and delete all the HP printer drivers listed there if any.Delete all the instances of your printer listed in devices and printers.Restart the PC.Once the PC is on the desktop, press Win + R, it would bring a Run dialog box, Type %temp% in the run box and click Ok or hit the Enter button.It would bring up the temporary files folder. Delete the files in the folder (You might not be able to delete all the files).If possible, delete the printer from the registries using Regedit or using any other 3rd party application.Ignore the Regedit option if it cannot be done.Restart the PC again. Then create a new user account as an administrator from this link:http://hp.care/2rZfJBCLog into the new user account after restarting your computer.Then download the latest full feature driver from http://hp.care/2wPQLu1 and install it on the computer after selecting the correct operating system.Connect the printer to your computer only when the setup prompts for the printer.This should fix the issue.If this does not do the trick, please download the Windows Built-in drivers by following instructions from this link: http://hp.care/2o3acvHThis will resolve the issue for you.Please perform all these steps patiently as it is critical to resolving the issue.

Inkjet printing is one of the most popular types of digital printing. These printers use ink to create your documents and images, and nearly all models are able to print in both black-and-white and color. But most people choose inkjet printers because they’re able to produce gorgeous color images. Choose an inkjet printer if you want to print professional-quality color photos or any documents that feature color imagery.
Laser printers are popular for businesses and for those who need to print out a high volume of documents. These printers use lasers and electromagnetism to create documents, and they’re generally much faster than inkjet printers. Most laser printers can’t print color documents, but we do produce a few HP color laser printers that can print high-quality color images at incredible speeds.
The design is appealing basic as you would expect from a compact printer at the affordable price range. DeskJet printer is using thermal inkjet technology for printing, copying and scanning the documents. Users easily set up the printer on desk, selves and anywhere according to need.

Inkjet and colour laser printing is assessed by a panel of experts looking at a typical black-and-white letter (25%), an 8x10-inch high quality photo (20%), a colour spreadsheet (25%), a colour document with a mixture of graphics and text (20%) and moisture resistance (5%). Black and white inkjet and laser printing looks at a typical black-and-white letter (31.25%), a colour spreadsheet (31.25%), a colour document with a mixture of graphics and text (31.25%) and moisture resistance (5%).
Colour inkjet and laser printing speed is assessed by measuring the speed to print the same documents, made up of 25% for the photo, 25% for the colour document, and 25% each for the letter and the spreadsheet. Black-and-white inkjet or laser printing speed is assessed by splitting assessments into equal thirds, and measuring the speed to print a mixed graphics and text document (33.33%), a letter (33.33%) and a spreadsheet (33.33%).
The maximum print output speed of the printer's engine, in pages per minute (ppm). Note that there is no standard for measuring print speed so advertised and actual output can vary greatly. It can take four times as long to print a colour page as a black-only page.
