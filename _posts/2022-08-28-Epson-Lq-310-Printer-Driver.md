Printing a Self Test Running the printer's self test helps you determine whether the printer or the computer is causing the problem: If the self test results are satisfactory, the printer is working properly and the problem is probably caused by your printer driver settings, application settings, computer, or interface cable. (Be sure to use a shielded interface cable.) If the self test does not print properly, there is a problem with the printer. See Problems and Solutions for possible causes and solutions to the problem. You can print the self test using either single sheets or continuous paper. See Printing on Continuous Paper or Printing on Single Sheets for paper-loading instructions.
