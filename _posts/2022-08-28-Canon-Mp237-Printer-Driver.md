Most device drivers you get from their original CDs have some bugs in them. These bugs are absent in the subsequent versions of that driver. Therefore, whenever a new version of your printer’s driver is released by its manufacturer, be sure to update it immediately.
It is showing Canon Pixma MP230 model number because canon MP230 is the main series printer on this series. Canon MP236, 237, 2038, 2039 comes in 230 series. All have the same chip (processors) in it, so all the model numbers use a single Canon 230 driver. So use the 230 main series driver on your MP237 printer, it will work for sure.

I am absolutely in love with this software! My Nikon COOL SCAN V would only work with Windows 98 so it's been our of commission for quite a while. Thanks to VueScan, it back online and working better than ever. It is so efficient and easy to use that I'm looking forward to scanning several thousand slides that have been stored away and unusable. My scanner now works so much better than it did originally that I am incredulous. I purchased the Pro version and it is worth every penny of the reasonable price. WOW! Love it! Thank You Hamrick!!!
I had tons of photos to scan, and after doing some research I decided to go for VueScan. I don't regret my decision. Scanning was a breeze and saved me a lot of time. I'm using a Brother All-in scanner which I bought 3 years ago and whilst its scanning software is not bad it's much slower and has way less options than VueScan. My operation system is Windows 10. I can recommend VueScan without hesitation. It''s worth the money.
In Jan 2003 I bought VueScan for my Epson Perfection 1200. I used it a lot, more functions than the standard driver. Got new computers with new operating systems, forgot about VueScan. I got a new Epson scanner - old one doesn't have Win10 drivers. I remembered VueScan. Found it, downloaded the trial version, and my old EPSON 1200 scanner WORKED again. Wow, a purchase made in 2003, works on a PC with an operating system that doesn't exist in 2003. 17 YEARS later! And that for a very small amount of money.
