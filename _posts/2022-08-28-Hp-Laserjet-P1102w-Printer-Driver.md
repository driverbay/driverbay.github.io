Joined forum to say thanks for information provided. Yet another Airbus pilot with problem installing the driver via the HP website (Laser Jet P1005). Even today Feb 10 still shows as 5.1 issued Oct 27, 2021 and requiring OS version 12.0 or earlier. The link to the Apple download 5.1.1 did install. Worth noting that the driver date shows as Dec 11, 2020 and that it is not compatible with OS v 12.
[Unfortunately, HP didn't immediately update their own driver installation package before macOS 12.0.1 and 12.1 arrived on the scene (unconscionable in my book, but who am I to say), so initially you couldn't download the drivers from HP. They have subsequently updated their driver package however, allowing it to be installed on macOS 12.+.]
Hey all, I looked high and low for a solution and was so grateful to find a youtube video with a fix for both Big Sur and Monterey that worked for my HP P1102 W. Pretty frustrating that the newest Mac OS driver listed on HPs site is for v10... He shares links to the drivers he found that worked perfectly for me exactly as he described. https://youtu.be/iB6TcLJMaak
Question: How do I get the updated driver for HP 1102w for Mac OS 10 El Capitan Version 10.11.6 ? The printer stopped working and remained in the offline mode despite restarts and unplugging etc. The iMac won't let me install the new download because it is not an official download from the App store, Please Advise.
The HP LaserJet P1102w does not appear to be a supported AirPrint model listed in About AirPrint - Apple Support. However, the printer is in fact mentioned in an old (February 13, 2012) iOS: AirPrint 101 HT4356 article. It cannot be ruled out that the model in question was made for an older AirPrint version.
I believe the reason is because before AirPrint was widely available (i.e., before you didn't require a specific driver), Apple used to supply these drivers automatically in earlier macOS versions, but in the latest macOSes Apple hasn't supplied them simply because they were not needed on new printers, but if you have an older printer you may still need to download the drivers. The HP drivers are still the same exact ones as before, but the HP installation package tested if the macOS version was less than 12.0, if so, then it would install. This caused a problem for macOS 12.0.1 since the version check then failed and the drivers would not be installed. I edited the package to change 12.0 to 15.0 so that the drivers could be installed on higher macOS versions. This worked well for my old HP printers.
No HP print drivers for Monterrey -- Ugh! After yesterdays upgrade to macOS 12.0.1 Monterrey and application installations on my MacBook Pro I moved on to installing the Hewlett Packard print drivers for the OS. Unfortunately HP doesn't have macOS 12.0.1 drivers available for my HP Color...
