Getting started with your new Brother printer, should be as simple as opening the package and plugging it into an empty USB slot. However, sometimes you can encounter issues where your printer stops working or fails to communicate with your PC or laptop. In that case, there’s a good chance that you will need to update the Brother HL-L2320D Laser Printer drivers

## Manage printer settings.

To change how the printer prints, click the “Printing Preferences” option in the Settings window or context menu. You’ll see a variety of options for controlling your prints here, and the settings you see will depend on the ones your printer supports.
If your PC has the right operating system, the next step is to simply download and update your printer drivers. Again, you can use a tool like DriverSupport for a hassle-free way to automatically download and update all drivers for your PC at the same time, without having to check other areas.
Normally, you must go into your printer’s preferences or properties to change various settings. However, this can be inconvenient when you have multiple groups of settings you want to toggle between. For example, perhaps you have a color printer on which you sometimes print high-quality color photos and sometimes print lower detail black and white documents.

You can also access these settings while printing. Just select a printer in the Print window and then click the “Preferences” button. Note that some applications have their own print dialogs, so this option might not always be present or the window might look different
Once you have selected the various printing options you like, you can save those options as a printer preset by selecting Save As... or Save Current Settings as Preset... from the Preset pop-up menu. You will be given an option to have the preset available for all printers or just for your current printer. In future print jobs, you can enable all of those options with the single step of selecting your saved preset from the Preset pop-up menu.
Print Settings1. Media TypeSelect the type of media you want to use. To achieve the best print results, the machine automatically adjustsits print settings according to the selected media type.2.

If you’re having trouble with a printer, you might need to do some troubleshooting. The basics are pretty obvious: Make sure the printer is powered on and connected to your computer—or your Wi-Fi or Ethernet network, if it’s a network printer. Ensure the printer has enough paper and check if it has sufficient ink or toner. Ink and toner status may appear in the printer’s settings window, or you may have to view this information by reading a screen on the printer itself. You might also need to install printer drivers from your printer’s manufacturer.
