Finally, another major problem that you can have with the Brother HL-1110 is its total cost of ownership, which is slightly on the high side. The operational costs of this printer add up to about 7.4 cents per page but that is with OEM provided cartridges. If you use generic cartridges, you can reduce this per-page cost to only six cents, which is slightly better but still not the best. It is worth mentioning that in personal use per-page costs usually become immaterial because individuals don’t tend to print high volumes.
