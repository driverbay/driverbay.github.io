Okay, it has finally worked. All I needed were two types of drivers:1. Install Driver USB. (DOT4) first2. Then, install Driver Universal (PCL6) and Select "USB Plug & Play" as the installation type.3. Finally, plug the printer's USB cable into the computer. (I had the USB cable plugged in before installing the drivers. This is the only difference for printing to have finally worked for me)Thanks to you all for this thread.
All Solved. I'll reply to it myself. I didn't see how to delete the question so I'll reply to it. There may be others as ignorant as myself, I suppose, who may have the same question.Well the answer is do nothing, really, what I'd done was all that was really required.When I went Win10/settings/Devices/Install Printer Win10 listed the printer amongst the devices (such as print to pdf) that it knows about.When I found a document and picked 'print' from the menu the HP3015 was listed.When I went 'print' it printed. No problem. Lovely print job, too.
Either you will have to install its Universal driver or go with its basic driver. I would suggest to download and install its universal driver first, if it is not working then go with its basic driver. You will have to install its basic driver manually on your computer. The basic and the universal driver are given in the download section above. You get the instructions to install its basic driver for a printer as well. So give it a try and do reply again if you face any problems while downloading or installing the drivers.

Hi Abrogard, I have installed DOT4 driver bundle first and then PCL6 boundle per another thread (from https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-3015-all-in-one-printer/378048) . But it did not work for me. There is no HP LaserJe 3015 in Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers. There are Driver Universal (PCL6) and Driver for USB (Dot4) at the above link. If these two of three items are not what you have installed, could you share the link for "Driver Universal, Driver for Managed Services and Driver for USB" that you have installed?Thanks.
There are two types of drivers that exist: a basic driver and a full feature driver. Basic drivers only have printer & scan driver but full feature package has all the drivers and all the software.
