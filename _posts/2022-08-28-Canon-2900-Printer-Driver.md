Try installing the software from the canon website here and ensure you follow the install instructions to the letter: specifically, once you have installed your drivers and it asks to restart the computer, TURN YOUR PRINTER OFF, and restart. Then, open sys preferences, turn the printer back on, and install normally. This worked for me after 2 tries installing the printer and getting 'canon generic' as the driver, and no printing ability. I can now print from my mac (10.5.2) with this driver no problems (on a LBP 5200, but I would assume it would work for other models too...)Hope this helps! YMMV...
