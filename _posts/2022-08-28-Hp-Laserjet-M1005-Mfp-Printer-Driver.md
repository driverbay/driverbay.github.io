HP LaserJet M1005 is a superb multifunction printer that addresses the small business or home printing needs. It can print on a variety of media types of ranging sizes and the paper holding capacity is good enough for small and medium business needs. The printing speed of 14 ppm is decent for this price range. But it isn’t best in all aspects, especially when you consider the fact that it doesn’t support wireless or Ethernet connectivity. If you want a printer that can share among all your devices, then you need to find some other printer.
