Since the printer is working fine in Mojave using the 4.50b driver , and that driver offers the HL-2130 as an option, that may be the first thing I attempt next. If it works, it ought to work in Mojave with Brother’s Mojave driver. And in Catalina with the Catalina driver.

## Brother hl-2040 printer driver for mac.

Thanks to all. I have tried Gutenprint drivers, after resetting CUPS. I had read on Linux forums that GhostScript plus a PPD for an HL-1250 works, so I tried that . The print enters and leaves the queue, but nothing happens at the printer. Just a steady READY light. The Brother Catalina driver for the HL-2130 has not yet been tried. I have also replied to the person I referred to above who is using his HL-2040 with an M1 iMac he received very recently- he says nothing to it, but that’s all he says.
This printer is great and really easy to use and I highly recommend it to all you mac users out there. It is a good, cheap, reliable printer.This printer is very economical, the ink lasts me for several months. This printer by brother is really easy to set up and use, I have had no problems with this printer, since we got it, which was several months ago. It is great that this printer is compatible with mac, as we have had problems with other printers, that say that they are mac-compatible in the past.This printer is too bulky and needs a bigger paper tray, because the one it has is quite inconvenient.
I purchased my Brother laser printer a couple of years ago and it has been running very reliably ever since. Setting it up on my Mac was easy; just plug it in and you're ready to go. The print quality is great for text but fairly average when it comes to printing graphics. I am still using the toner cartridge that came with the machine so it has been quite economical and far better than my previous inkjet printers. This model has since been superceded so I'm not sure if I can still buy replacement accessories for it, however, during its lifetime, it has performed well so I would happily considered buying another Brother printer.Cheap, fast, easy to setup, economicalWill sometimes curl the paper, a bit noisy
I have just tried setting up the Brother HL-2040 in Mojave, using the 4.50b driver, but when choosing software, opting for HL-2130 CUPS. Printing performance seems perfect. Therefore, I really don't foresee any issues using the Catalina driver for an HL-2130 for this printer in Catalina.
The best aspect of brother is that it has a compatible discount ink. It is very easy to replace the catridges too. It always gives a good warning when ink levels are low.A nice set up. The printing works well, as does the scanning.I havee't had any problems with Brother.
Finally completed the Catalina installation, connected the printer and installed the Catalina software for the HL-2130. Version 1.5.0. Complete success for the HL-2040. We hope to move on to Big Sur in the next couple of months. I truly hope it works. Who knows how difficult Monterey will make things. Apple seems to be trying to draw a line in the sand.
The controller of the system uses a SparcLite processor that runs at a speed of 96 MHz. In addition to this feature, the printer also has an internal memory of 8 MB of RAM. These two features are essential for great speed and good quality. The print interface runs with a full-speed USB 2.0 port as well as IEEE 1284 parallel. Other options include 802.11b wireless (NC-2200w) and Ethernet LAN 10/100Base-TX (NC-2100p). In the same way, network productivity protocols include TCP/IP and NetBEUI.
