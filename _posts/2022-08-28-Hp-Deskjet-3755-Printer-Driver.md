I have installed the printer, and my "Settings" acknowledges this as the default printer but also states "Drivers unavailable". I have tried to find the appropriate Drivers through many online sources but to no avail. I understand I can get the DeskJet 3755 Installation CD for my system. and have requested it. Will this provide the solution to my problem?RalphSM
First and foremost, make sure you’ve properly removed the printer from its box with all included pieces for swift and organized assembly. It is easy to rush through the simplest part blinded by excitement and haste, and even easier to skip the most basic of steps.
If it still does not appear, an option under the “Refresh” button should appear that reads “The printer that I want isn’t listed.” Windows’ integrated troubleshooting guide will take over and search for available linked printers. Once located, Windows will provide the corresponding driver for you to download to complete the installation.
Technology can be extremely fussy, and even more so when it’s brand new and you expect things to run smoothly. If your computer is not responding to your new printer connection by prompting the installation of the printer’s software, here’s an easy fix.

Your HP DeskJet 3755 All-in-One Printer requires the latest driver software to function properly and unlock new features. If you’re looking for the latest HP DeskJet 3755 All-in-One Printer Driver, you’ve come to the right place! This post will show you how to download and install the latest driver for HP DeskJet 3755 (and also other HP DeskJet series).
(This requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
Hi, I had my 3755 working, then all of a sudden -my computer could no longer see it. The answer is great the only problem is when I go to that link it says, "hp support is temporarily unavailable". I do think that is the solution. As it says that there is an updated driver...so I guess I have to wait until hp support is up and running again?
To install the hp driver the same way as installing other applications, the way is easy enough just follow the instructions that exist when the driver is installed to the computer. Each display for the driver install menu is different because it is adjusted to the function of the device, so when installing the driver it is mandatory to read the guide before clicking next/install.

## Connect the hp deskjet 3755 printer to your computer.

As a manufacturer, HP provides printer drivers for their products on its official website. If you’re a tech-savvy user, you can just follow the steps below to download and install the latest driver for your HP DeskJet 3755 All-in-One Printer on your own:
Once you’ve got all the pieces of the puzzle laid out and ready for configuration, plug the double-pronged end of the power cable into a conveniently located outlet. Your printer may automatically turn on or you may need to press a power button to wake the machine up. This is where we come in.
“hpprinterseries.net” ~ The complete solution software includes everything you need to install the HP DeskJet 3755 Driver. This collection of software includes a complete set of hp drivers, installer software, and other administrative tools found on the printer software CD.
To set up a printer for the first time, remove the printer and all packing materials from the box, connect the power cable, install the ink cartridges, load paper into the input tray, download and install the printer software, and then align the ink cartridges.
Among your puzzle pieces should be a USB cable that connects directly into your computer’s tower or your laptop’s body. Depending on your computer’s operating system, your computer should notify you that a new connection is being made and that a driver will need to be downloaded for it to complete the installation.
The HP ePrint Software makes it easy to print from a laptop or desktop PC to all HP ePrinter. You can easily print your digital content wirelessly to an HP printer that is supported on local wireless networks (Wi-Fi), HP printers are enabled Wireless or wired LAN, or via Direct WiFi. In addition, you can print to your HP ePrint-enabled printer through the cloud at office, home, or on the go, whenever the printer is connected to the Internet. You can even print to thousands of HP ePrint Public Print Locations around the world.
The HP Print Service Plugin is the only print driver that you'll need to easily print documents, emails and pictures from print-supported applications to a variety of HP Printers, including HP OfficeJet, HP LaserJet, HP DesignJet, HP Photosmart, HP DeskJet and HP Envy.
The app works very well. With new features I can now send an email directly to the printer. I can also print an attachment after downloading it to my saved files. The attachment doesn't have to be pdf. I have downloaded Word Documents as well. I still like this app three years after my first review. It never has let me down, and I use it often. HP has done an outstanding job of keeping it current. I use the app on my Android as well as my iPhone.
