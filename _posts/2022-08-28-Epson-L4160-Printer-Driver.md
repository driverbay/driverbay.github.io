In Jan 2003 I bought VueScan for my Epson Perfection 1200. I used it a lot, more functions than the standard driver. Got new computers with new operating systems, forgot about VueScan. I got a new Epson scanner - old one doesn't have Win10 drivers. I remembered VueScan. Found it, downloaded the trial version, and my old EPSON 1200 scanner WORKED again. Wow, a purchase made in 2003, works on a PC with an operating system that doesn't exist in 2003. 17 YEARS later! And that for a very small amount of money. THIS IS SERVICE AND ADDING VALUE TO YOUR CUSTOMER!

I am absolutely in love with this software! My Nikon COOL SCAN V would only work with Windows 98 so it's been our of commission for quite a while. Thanks to VueScan, it back online and working better than ever. It is so efficient and easy to use that I'm looking forward to scanning several thousand slides that have been stored away and unusable. My scanner now works so much better than it did originally that I am incredulous. I purchased the Pro version and it is worth every penny of the reasonable price. WOW! Love it! Thank You Hamrick!!!
