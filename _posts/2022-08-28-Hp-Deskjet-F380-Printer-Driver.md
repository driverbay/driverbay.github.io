I did some research, and it turns out that you don't aren't likely something wrong. I downloaded the software for this printer, and it seems that the software version 32A omitted the ability to save your document as what files whether other than PDF or TIFF.
The paper to be scanned should be located on the right corner side of the scanning area. After proper placement, close the top of the scanner. Select scan option on your printers control panel. An individual can save your preferences for scanning the document and the path where you need to save the document.
Printers without a touchscreen control panel: On the printer, press and hold the Wireless button for five seconds or until the light starts blinking. Within two minutes, press and hold the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) button on the router until the connection process begins.
With the older software, the solution I posted above would have worked, but I feel that our software has taken a step backwards rather than forwards. The only solution I can think of at this point is not ideal, but it is doable. You can download a file converter, save your files in PDF format, then convert them.

Hi tmehta, I understand that since you have recently changed your cartridges in your DeskJet F380, you are now receiving an error message stating the cartridges are empty. Was your F380 turned on when you installed the cartridges? I ask because the printer must be powered on when installing cartridges, if you happened to install them while it was off this could be the cause of your error message. I would like you to go ahead and remove the cartridges and then reset your product: Unplug the printer from it's power source (please do not power off first), wait 60 seconds and plug it directly into the wall outlet and make sure the F380 is fully powered up before installing the cartridges. Make sure you are using genuine HP cartridges- If you are still running into the error you may need to clean the contacts on the cartridges as well as inside the machine. Please follow the steps listed below: Turn on the HP product. Open the print cartridge access door. Remove both cartridges. Wipe the electrical contact points of the print cartridge with a cloth. Print cartridges ship from the factory with a thin coating of protective grease on them to prevent oxidation. This coating may be preventing good electrical contact. Unplug the power cord, wait five seconds, and then plug it back in. Reinstall the print cartridges. Perform a print cartridge alignment if prompted. I look forward to hearing from you, please let me know the results. Thanks,
