## Brother hl-2130 printer driver for mac.

I have the same problem, trying to install a Brother printer driver for the HL-2250DN on a MBP runing 10.9.1. I've tried downloading and installing the saoftware from the Brother site, have tried everything suggested above, and each time Apple tries to install the driver i get the same error message
My Brother HL-2132 cannot be detected in both of my iMac (Mid 2011 model, OSX Yosemite) and MacBook Pro (Mid 2015 model, OSX El Capitan). I moved the printer from one table to another table. Before it was moved, it works perfectly fine. But then when I tried to print it again from the new table, it says "Printer is not connected." I tried to unplug and plug the USB port from both the printer and my computer but it still doesn't recognise. I also have tried to turn it on and off, download the latest printer software for this printer. It still doesn't solve my problem.
Brother's Printer was not impressed by his modern appearance. Too bad there is no black version. Although the visual defects are small, it is difficult to find a better model with an input capacity of 250 sheets of A4 paper, which prints 20 pages per minute. The resolution may seem low because it is only 2400 to 600 dpi, but it is the standard value for a Mono laser printer.
What is wrong with my printer? Is it the printer's USB port or does it not compatible with the latest OSX version? Keep in mind, my iMac is OSX Yosemite. So it's not the latest OSX. However, my MacBook Pro is indeed the latest OSX which is OSX El Capitan. Do I have to fix the printer's USB port or do I have to buy the new USB port cable for my printer?
