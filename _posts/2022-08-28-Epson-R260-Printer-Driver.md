If you have none, then you will be glad to know that epsondriverseries.net will give you the official driver & software that you can directly download from this link below. Of course, the steps by step are also easy to follow.
If you opt to print through the printer driver, you must also select the correct paper profile and ensure the software is set to ‘Let Printer Set Colours’. Make sure the driver interface is set for Best Photo quality and select Photo Enhance to access the fine-tuning controls the driver provides.
When you’re ready to print, check that the paper profile is correct and select Manual -Rear as the paper Source setting. Open the Size dropdown menu and select User Defined. (This setting won’t appear if you’ve selected Borderless printing in the printer driver because borderless printing is not supported in this mode.)

You can also choose between having the software or the printer control colour management. When the software controls colours, the appropriate paper profile must be selected before moving to the printer driver and the printer driver mode must be set to ‘off (No Colour Adjustment). The correct paper profile must also be set in the printer driver (see below).
A few things have gone wrong. I've had a few paper misfeeds, more than one sheet fed at a time. Thsi happened on my R1900 some times too mainly with Ultra Premium Matte. So watch for that. I've also had a driver problem. When I started printing the 17x22 posters, 10 at a time, 3 different posters. It seems that the driver got confused and half way through printing the first 10, it started using the settings from the second 10. I canceled all the jobs and did one poster at a time (e.g. 10 at a time) and everything was fine.
I've gotten excellent quality of prints from this printer. However, there have been errors & issues with it. At first, the people at Epson were very nice and addressed the issues accordingly. But after the third or fourth problem, they suddenly told me I didn't have a warranty and would do nothing for me. This was after only 5 months after purchase. The printer was supposed to come with a one-year warranty.
One feature we weren’t particularly happy with was the driver’s tendency to re-set the quality settings to favour output speeds each time you make any changes to the printing parameters in the driver interface. This only happens when changes are made so, when you’re making a series of prints on the same type and size of paper it won’t bother you. However, change just one parameter and the printer defaults to the Speed setting and you must open the dropdown menu and select Quality Options in order to uncheck the High Speed box and set the quality slider to maximum.
