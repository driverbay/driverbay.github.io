You mean a complete delete and reinstall of the printer software and drivers? I recently did that for my laptop (different machine to the one I was originally talking about) and it’s exactly the same as the software/drivers on the PC and also devoid of colour matching to the Laptop screen (although for the laptop I don’t mind). Why do you think a reinstall will work for the PC? Are there version numbers I can check before proceeding? The Epson update via existing software claims it is up to date.
As I also use network printing I’d hate to go through the entire process of resetting everything, only to find there is no change.
Yes, it is true that re-installing a network/wifi printer is a pain. We are suggesting this because most of the time drivers are getting corrupted, conflicted, or malfunctioned. So, if you have tried everything and nothing has worked for you then you should go with this.
