Brother QL-570 Driver Download for Windows and Mac – The QL-570 is Bro’s second-generation office label printer for tags up to simply over 2.4 inches broad. Earlier designs incorporated an outstanding item of equipment with less-than-impressive software. The QL-570 retains everything great concerning the previous hardware (most significantly, the convenience of switching in between various rolls of tags); enhances some hardware features, like speed and size; as well as brings the software program practically approximately the very same degree as the hardware, placing it within shooting range of “excellent.”.
We are trying to help you find a Label Printer Software option that includes everything you need to be able to install or using your Brother printer. Here we will provide the latest Label Printer Software for the Brother QL-500 Series, compatible with Windows 32 and 64 bit, Mac OS and Linux.
Brother QL-500 Driver Download for Windows and Mac – The QL-500 is 7.7 inches instead of the typical four by 6 inches you’ll discover in versions from Avery, Dymo, as well as Seiko Instruments. That larger dimension is a tiny cost to spend for all the additionals you obtain, beginning with the capacity to print on tags up to 2.4 inches while only having to spend $100 for the printer.
Among the many more excellent features of the QL-570 is how easy it is to exchange tag rolls. Brother’s rolls come placed on spools that you break into location in the printer, then feed via a slot. Switching roles is quick and also simple, so you can easily make use of various tag formats.
The QL-570’s software program, vastly improved over the version I assessed with the QL-500, is sensibly simple to find out and use and supplies several welcome functions, most significantly a Snap mode that functions like an image-capture program. Choosing Break hides the Brother software application from view– besides a little Snap mode text box. You can either choose an area on the screen and insert it right into a label as a visual or pick a text and drag it to the text box to put the option as text.
Brother’s tag rolls come currently mounted on spools that you drop right into the printer, and the feed design makes it uncommonly easy to string the tags. That makes changing from one style to another fast and easy and something you are a lot more most likely to do.
The QL-570’s print rate is another strength. Bro declares a 68-label-per-minute rate for common address labels. Utilizing a three-line address, I printed 68 3.5-inch-long labels in 1 minute 4 seconds– a hair slower than the case, however still faster than many other office label printers. This might not conserve much time when you’re printing a solitary address tag. Yet with various other printers, I’ve been left feeling like I’m waiting on a tag, even if just for a second or 2. That will not occur with the QL-570.
