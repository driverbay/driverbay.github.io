If you’re setting up a new printer, you’ll need to download the driver onto your computer. But you might also need to re-install the driver if it accidentally gets deleted from your computer (maybe during a computer crash or BIOS failure) or if it becomes corrupted.
If a printer driver is not installed on your computer, or if it’s improperly installed, then your computer won’t be able to detect the printer or complete even the simplest printing tasks. Whenever you buy a new printer, you’ll have to install that printer’s driver on every computer that you wish to print from.
The device has no automatic paper sensor that could have helped it run with picking up papers, but that also isn’t a problem. Connecting with this printer requires a wireless or through the hi-speed USB port. Furthermore, the device is compatible with mobile printing features such as HP ePrint software.

Easy explanation: because each tool is used in a different way, drivers in the real world such as manuals that contain guidance on how a tool is used and must be learned by the human brain in order to use the tool. once again humans can learn by themselves, while the computer does not, so that the operating system can control the newly installed devices to the computer (such as printers, scanners, VGA, mouse, keyboards) drivers must be installed first.
