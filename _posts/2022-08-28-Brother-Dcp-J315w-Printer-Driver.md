Read moreliances. After a week I rang Brother who suggested a try a different power cord which didn't work and gave me the name of a repairer. The cost to put in a new power supply is $132.00 more than a new printer. I had just replaced three of the four inks. Unless I get the same model the inks I have in the machine and spares (worth over $100) are wasted as each Brother model as different inks. The moral of the story is don't buy Brother. RhondaW.

When I came to my computer on friday - I realised that Windows had run an upgrade overnight during the day I realised that my printer a BROTHER DCP-J315W was no longer working I tried to run the brother support troubleshooting and it suggested that I de-install and reinstall the printer but this did not seem to help then I noticed that there were other updates which were waiting in the wings - so I thought it best to run these and then try the printer again so the following updates were installed satisfactorily
Windows 10 version 2004 Quality Updates 2020-05 Cumulative Update for .NET framework 3.5 and 4.8 KB4552925
2020-06 Security Update for Adobe Flash Player KB 4561600
today I have spent a lot of time de-installing and re-installing the printer I tried connecting it directly it does the same thing - I try to print a test page - it says the test page has gone to the print queue - I can see it in the print queue - then it disappears but nothing is printed Any ideas - I am a trifle bereft thank you
I've had worse printers. I got this because i can get cheap ink refills online, which is a big game changer for as i dont want to pay expensive refills or having to take it to a refill the same cartridge thingy.. The networking on this printer is a hit and miss, but failing to connect at the best of times. Apart from that it does what its meant to do, print, scan and copy.
Read more is that if one cartridge is empty, the printer stops till its replaced even if its not a colour needed for the job at hand. Extremely disappointed & will be replacing it as soon as possible.
Internal paper tray, keeps the paper flat & clean.
Poor reproduction of photos & quality of general print. Expensive ink cartridges. Complicated settings when not using default.
I had problems with misalignment which seem to get sorted after a whole lot of troubleshooting steps. I love this printer because unlike previous inkjets I've owned, the ink doesn't just dry up. I can hear the periodic, automated head cleaning. Also, I always seem to get many more prints than expected out of the ink cartridges.
Previously i didn't have a problem with this printer and I've owned it over a year now. I had a few issues with the printer cartridges not reading properly or always needing to clean it before using. But for the last month I have not been able to use it properly due to cronic mis-alignment. I follow all the instructions to align and it doesn't change a thing. I went out and brought a Canon....
