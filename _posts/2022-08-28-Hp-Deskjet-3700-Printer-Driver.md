We have managed to use this printer exactly 3 times, and all three times it has been horrendous. It acts as though it has never been used ever every time and each time, we have had to use the print and scan doctor program before use. It also decides that each print cartridge is really only good to use once and then after that it decides you need a new one, even if all you’ve printed is one page. A complete waste of time and money. Invest in a different brand!
