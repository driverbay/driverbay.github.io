The print driver provides many options that can be set to different values when printing a particular job. A quick set stores the values for a print job, so that you can set them all with a single click.

HP Real Life settings can be changed in the Features, Advanced, or Paper/Quality tab, or in Advanced Options. The Printing Shortcut tab might also include shortcuts with this option.
Some printer models include settings that allow you to change how ink or toner is applied to the paper, including how much ink to use, control of individual colors, and how long the printer holds the print for drying. Ink and toner settings can be changed on the Color or Advanced tab.
In addition, the manufacturer recommends that the operating humidity range be between 20 and 80% with no condensation. However, when the machine is not in operation but storage, the relative humidity range of 5 to 90% is appropriate. Similarly, the acceptable temperature range for printing is between 15 and 300C. Whereas, when the machine is in storage, the recommended temperature range is between -40 and 600C.
