## Brother printer drivers are essential for using your printer with windows.

If you are connecting your Brother machine via USB connection: The built-in drivers you can install via USB connection are the printer driver and scanner driver*1. The drivers are installed automatically by connecting your Brother machine to the PC running Windows 7 with a USB cable. (*1Available only for Brother machines with scanner function.)
Brother printer driver is an application software program that works on a computer to communicate with a printer. When a print command from a computer is sent to the printer, “Printer Driver” acts like an intermediary and converts information from this program into a language format that can be understood by the printer and operating system that is used on certain computers such as Windows XP, 7, Windows 10. This is important enough to use suitable drivers to avoid problems when printing.
When we attach a USB cable to an Brother hl printer, the computer will try to recognize it and if it has a suitable driver, it can do an automatic installation and print. If the computer does not recognize the printer, we need to install the driver. The new printer is equipped with a CD that contains a Printer driver for a different operating system, which allows us to install manually.
A range of printer-related problems is caused by a wrong or out-of-date printer driver. So if you’re troubled by the non-working Brother printer, be sure to update its driver and see if the problem gets resolved. There’re two options for you: manually or automatically.
Sometimes, the Brother printer not printing issue only happens with certain programs. You can test the printer by printing from another program. If it works well, the problem lies in the application you run and you should contact its vendor or developer for further assistance. But if the problem remains, please proceed to the last fix.
Select Brother in the Manufacturer list and click Windows Update. While the drivers are being downloaded, the Windows Update button will become inactive. It takes a few minutes to download the drivers. When the downloading is finished, the Windows Update button will become active again, and then go to Step 6.
But this review is about the product itself. All the toners had been installed when it arrived (which triggered alarm bells). However, it connected to my WiFi router with no problems. Setting up the drivers on the PC generated an error message which told me to restart the PC and re-run the installation. But I didn't and it was all set up correctly anyway. Connected first time. There are some weird Brother offers to bypass on the way to registration. Instructions are not always accurate so needs a little guesswork. Actually relatively straightforward compared to some nightmare printer installations.
