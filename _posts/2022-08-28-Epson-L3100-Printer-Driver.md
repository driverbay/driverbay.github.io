Worst product ever, if you care about your money not to get wasted then stay away from this printer. It worked well for 3 days bit on the 4th day it's paper is getting jammed everytime I try to print something. No support from flipkart or epson at all. No refund no replacement. Think twice before considering this printer.
1) Simply connect your printer to another USB port on your computer, it works most of the time.
2) Make sure your printer’s USB cable should not be connected to the computer at the time you start installing it. The driver installer will ask you to connect the printer, then you can connect your printer to the computer so that it can identify the printer along with its port.
3) Also make sure your printer is connected directly to the computer without any USB hub or extension.
4) If you are installing it manually, then make sure you are selecting the correct port (USB001, 002, 003).
Some printer manufacturers make printers and scanners drivers in one combo pack so that there is no need to install the scanner driver separately. For the L3100 printer, you’ll have to install both the printer and scanner separately. I have provided both links in the download section below.

Not a very user friendly printer..Canon in this price range will be a good deal. Not even printed 20 pages and had to schedule three engineer visits. This printer has a problem of reaching ink to head which their engineer resolves by doing a manual suction using disposable syringe, not a worth and trustworthy printer to buy.

Printer is really good using it since more than 15 days. Excellent print quality. But its little bit slow in photocopy/scanning. It's wifi feature is really useful, I can print from my mobile. Really recommended. Until now I printed more than 1500+ prints. with 1 bottle black ink refilled which cost me just Rs. 300. So it's cost effective also. Thanks Epson & Flipkart.
At a high printing target of 5760 dpi, the Epson L3100 prints convey unusually fine prints for each one of your requirements. The fast print prices of approximately 10ipm for dark, as well as 5.0 ipm for shading, will certainly be valued. The Epson L3100 was also designed for the printing of indeterminate images up to 4R.
