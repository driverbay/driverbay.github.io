## Install the hp deskjet 2336 printer driver.

Don't bother to even update your Mac to the latest software. I too read up about this issue and was told in support.apple.com to try update MacOs before trying to connect the printer again, and so i went on and updated it to macOs Big Sur 11.0.1 and ended up going into Apple workshop. It's gonna add more problem to your laptop. HP DeskJet 2336 is just a waste of money.

@AF14, Welcome to HP Support Community!To be able to assist you better, I would like to know the following:1.) Is there any antivirus software installed on your Mac? If yes, please try disabling it and check if it works.2.) Are you using a USB hub? If yes, disconnect and connect the printer directly to the computer.Meanwhile, check the following-1.) Go to System Information to check if the USB is detected or not -a.) From the Apple menu, choose About This Mac.b.) Click System Report.c.) Under the Hardware heading on the left side of the System Information window, click USB. USB 3 devices appear under USB 3.0 Bus, and USB 2 devices appear under USB 2.0 Bus. The printer should be under the USB 2.0 Bus.2.) Try a different port and cable if not detected.Keep me posted for further assistance.
hai, you had the same problem with me. Apparently the hp customer service ask me to update my mac to the latest software which is Catalina. It seems that you had the problem even when using the latest mac software. I think HP DESKJET 2336 is not compatible with Mac

Find the Microsoft XPS Document Writer folder, select the check box next to it, and select OK. If the check box is already checked, clear it and select OK. Then reopen the Windows Features window you were just using and recheck the box to reinstall the XPS file printer.
I have been facing the same issues, asking to hp support yet not working. I guess hp still doesn't provide proper mac driver for 2336. It's detected in easy setup but not with hp smart.I found temporary WORKING solution. Install hp driver from apple: https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1888?locale=en_USdirect link: https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/041-88763-20191011-6e70f498-9d39-420c-b11b-b252b17233e2/Hewl...Install printer through printer and scanners preference pane, add printer, select other driver and I choose HP 2540 all in one driver. It can print yet scanner is not detected. At least the printer is usable on Mac. Queueing quiet slow though.
Thank you for your reply. I can now connect my computer with the printer. But, when I tried to print something, it seems the printer cannot print really well. There were area that it can print and there were area that were missing. however, when I am trying to copy, it was working really well. It can copy without any problems (missing fonts/ pictures can be printed well), Do you encounter the same problem?Otherwise, I am hopeful that Hp will have a driver for Mac for HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2336. the retailer that I am buying from also did not know that this printer not supported with Mac. it is just a waste of money buying this product.
