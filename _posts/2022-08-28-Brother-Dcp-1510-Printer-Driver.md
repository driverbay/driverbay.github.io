I love my new printer, I previously use Brother Printer as well - the only thing I did not like I tried reaching out to the manufacturer and was asking for the USB so I can start printing. I was inform by Brother that they dont supply USB, it was pretty difficult that during the pandemic I cannot just go to the shop to buy one. I am bit disppointed when the packaging says USB is included.

The power lead is incorporated, which prevents you from shedding it if moving the machine.
