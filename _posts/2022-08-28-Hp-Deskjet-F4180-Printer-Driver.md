HP Deskjet F4180 All-in-One Printer/Scanner/Copier (CB584A#A2L) Bought this to go with my new computer about a month ago. Liked the price and after reading many reviews on many similar makes and models, picked this one. My new computer has Vista and I had no trouble getting the software to load and everything going smoothly. Use is for personal home, so it doesn't get daily workout. It is a bit on the noisy side but I'll live with that. For a light-duty home-use printer, scanner, copier, the print quality is good. You'll have to buy the USB cord as it doesn't come with the printer...???
First, I don't know if this is standard practice, but the printer didn't come with the usb cable to connect it to your pc. HP generally isn't the cheapest brand, but I've generally felt the quality of the product warranted the price. Cost cutting like this really leave a bad aftertaste.

Some users undermine the importance of properly uninstalling the old printer driver before installing the new one. This negligence can lead to driver conflicts between the files of old and new printer drivers. Therefore, for efficient performance of the newly installed driver, you must first uninstall the old driver.

Great price at Amazon and it prints and copies well. The price of a replacement cartridge is much less than my old Dell laser printer. Have owned this printer about two months now and twice have had jammimg issues. However, I really don't do much printing and this is an easy problem to fix so its not a big deal for me. Not sure if I would buy it for daily/frequent/heavy printing use though. Definitely buy the cord to hook up the printer to your computer- its not included and even Walmart wanted twice as much as the one they offer here on Amazon. So- nice price, decent printing (a step down from laser but this was a trade off I anticipated)-great for light use.

I previously owned a Lexmark X1290 that was hit and miss on Vista. In the end the Lexmark would only print (poor quality at best) instead of allowing me to scan, copy and print photos. I could never get the software to function thus it rendered the printer basically useless. The HP 4180 was purchased for the price, the reputation of HP and the consistently favorable reviews. It works well with Vista which is important since my PC is new and only shipped with Vista. So far I have printed several documents and a couple of photos. I've scanned a few items as well. I'm very pleased with the function of the 4180. It is rather noisy when printing though. The lowest setting for printing in draft mode prints a very readeable and clear type. The availability of ink (reasonably priced) and the selection between mild usage (hp 21 & 22) or heavy usage (hp 54 & 57) ink is a positive to me. I also like the fact that the design of the 4180 takes up much less space than my previous printer. The software with the HP is basic but functional. The photo software is of the most basic. I would recommend Adobe Photoshop or Roxio as the main photo editor. All in all I'm glad for the purchase through Amazon. The price was excellent and the printer arrived in just five days.
