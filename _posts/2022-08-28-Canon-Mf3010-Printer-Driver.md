The MF3010 is compatible with almost all PCs running Mac and Windows operating systems, and all the drivers you need come on a single disc in the box. Installation is as simple and takes only a few minutes since there's no wireless detail to fill in, and you can also install two extra tools: MF Toolbox and Presto PageManager.
Windows 10 compatibility is high on Canon’s website, with the vast majority of models being compatible. Ensure that your Canon product works with Windows 10 by visiting the Canon USA website and selecting a printer category, model name, and then drivers and software.
Unfortunately, the MF3010 has a few physical limitations compared with other laser printers. As stated earlier, the printer lacks both an autodocument feeder (ADF) and autoduplexing (double-sided printing), and you can only connect it to a single host computer using the USB port on the back (no cable is provided). Additionally, the copy machine is stunted by a 29-sheet maximum copying capacity, and the smaller scanner bay is limited to 8.5x11-inch prints at 600dpi by 600dpi.
Conclusion
The ImageClass MF3010 is easy to set up and use as a daily output device for students and office professionals, but its single-user connection and lack of extra features limit its usability for high-volume printing. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit for budget-minded consumers, but there are better options available if you need more functionality and you're willing to spend more money.

Canon ImageClass MF3010n machine uses the laser print technology to produce all-in-one functionality. Its available functions include printing, copying, and scanning to deliver the best performance of output. The printing rate is up to 18 pages per minute (ppm) when using the A4 paper. Besides, the average print resolution is about 600 x 400 dots per inch (dpi). However, the optimum print quality resolution is up to 1200 x 600 dpi with the automatic image refinement (AIR) component.
Performance
The MF3010 appears to trail the competition in our monochrome-text throughput test, but the difference between the scores is so slight that you likely won't notice a speed difference unless you're consistently printing multipage (20-plus) documents at a time. The ImageClass MF3010 can't match the Oki B431dn's impressive 33.86-page-per-minute (PPM) text speed score, but it was still able to exceed the Lexmark E460dw in the 10-page presentation test by more than 8 PPM. Additionally, the Canon MF3010 is exceptionally good about outputting continuous pages without the breaks or pauses that normally bog down the overall speeds of competing lasers.

The Canon ImageClass MF3010 multifunction monolaser printer is best suited for dorm rooms and small offices that require a simple laser printer for outputting e-mails, Web articles, recipes, and other print jobs that don't require full-color output. Priced at $150, it's one of the least expensive overall values for an all-in-one laser (print, scan, copy), but the trade-off is that you don't get extra features like an autodocument feeder for hands-free scans, or the benefit of multiuser networking. Instead, the MF3010's best feature is its speed--it sailed through our performance tests with no pauses or jams, and we recommend it to anyone looking for a straightforward, dependable laser printer for personal use.
