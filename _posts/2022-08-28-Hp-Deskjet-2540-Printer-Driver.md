Milenasn,During an online chat with HP technician David, we found out that my scanner light did not work. So this could not be fixed unfortunatly. HP offered me a cashback voucher for 20% discount to buy a new hp2540. I did so, connected it with the same wires and that worked again as it did before.Good luck!PietvL
Press and hold the Wireless button on the printer until it blinks, and then press and hold the WPS button on your router. Wait for the wireless light to stop blinking and remain solid. Print another network configuration report, and then find the IP address.
