I am absolutely in love with this software! My Nikon COOL SCAN V would only work with Windows 98 so it's been our of commission for quite a while. Thanks to VueScan, it back online and working better than ever. It is so efficient and easy to use that I'm looking forward to scanning several thousand slides that have been stored away and unusable. My scanner now works so much better than it did originally that I am incredulous. I purchased the Pro version and it is worth every penny of the reasonable price. WOW! Love it! Thank You Hamrick!!!
