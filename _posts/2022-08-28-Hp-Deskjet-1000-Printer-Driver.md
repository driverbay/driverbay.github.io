@cag8fThank you for posting on HP Forums, Riddle_Decipher is at your service. As I understand you need a driver for your printer compatible with the MacOS,I'd like to thank you for the detailed description of your concern, as you have ensured I don't have to ask any more questions, that said, here's what I recommend you do:Install the best available HP print driver and software on your Mac using Apple Software Update. Before installing the software, turn on the printer and make sure it is connected to the computer you want to print or scan from, either with a USB cable or through your local Wi-Fi or wired network. NOTE:Since October 2016, HP printer software packages are no longer delivered through Apple Software Update. Visit 123.hp.com to download the latest HP software for your printer. Alternatively, if your printer supports Apple AirPrint, you do not need a driver to print from your Mac or iOS device. For more information, go to About AirPrint (in English).CLICK HERE FOR MORE STEPS AND INSTRUCTIONS.(By the end of this article all the issues should be resolved)Let me know how that pans outfeel free to give me a virtual high-five by clicking the 'Thumbs Up' icon,followed by clicking on 'Accepted as Solution' as it would help the community gain more knowledge,And Have a great day Ahead!
@cag8fHi,as @Riddle_Decipher is out of the office today, I'm replying to you. I reviewed your post and would like to inform you that the full featured drivers are not available for Mac OS 10.13.1. Therefore @Riddle_Decipher has suggested that you could attempt to install the printer drivers through the Mac OS update. The Mac OS contains a lot of drivers for HP printers.I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to keep us for any further queries. Take care!
Here is an update. I connected the printer to the computer and followed the on-screen instructions to install the printer. It did so without issue. When I printed a test page, all colors (magenta, yellow, black) printed without issue, but the cyan ink did not print at all. I tried to run a printhead clean, and it did not complete--it hung indefinitely. I did tried this twice, both with the same results. I then connected the printer to a Windows computer and was able to run a printhead clean without issue. I ran several of them, then printed a test page, and it still had the missing cyan ink issue.Let's close this particular issue. I may open a new issue for the cyan ink issue.Thanks.
Once you download your new driver, then you need to install it. To install a driver in Windows, you will need to use a built-in utility called Device Manager. It allows you to see all of the devices recognized by your system, and the drivers associated with them.

Hello. I would like to use my HP DeskJet 1000 with my MacBook Pro running OS version 10.13.1. But the drivers page does not indicate a driver compatible with this version--only MacOS v10.12. Will I be able to install the printer on my computer using the driver for v10.12?Thanks in advance.
The HP Deskjet 1000 driver was never meant to be a high-end printer. It was just made to meet the minor printing needs that a lot of people have. Also, it was to offer a cheaper alternative to some of the higher end versions out there. When you think about it though, it’s done a pretty good job at that.While in operation, the HP DeskJet 1000 consumes 10 Watts of power. That is the basic and conventional printer power consumption level, so you shouldn’t have issues with that.
To install the hp driver the same way as installing other applications, the way is easy enough just follow the instructions that exist when the driver is installed to the computer. Each display for the driver install menu is different because it is adjusted to the function of the device, so when installing the driver it is mandatory to read the guide before clicking next/install.
