Have you also tried the Apple download at HP 5.1.1 Printer Software Update?

So, something like the HP LaserJet Professional M1130 MFP Series driver (version 1.8) could perhaps be worth a try anyway. However, it may not work/install at all. Look upon this as an experiment only. Make sure that you have backup copies of all important files (documents, photos, et cetera) before testing anything.
HP LaserJet Pro M1132 MFP is chosen because of its wonderful performance. You can use this printer to print your documents and photos in its best result. Before printing and finding out the amazing result, let’s learn first about how to install HP LaserJet Pro M1132 MFP.
HP's LaserJet M1132 MFP is based around a mono laser printer. While this rules out colour prints, it should mean that black text looks good and prints quickly. The M1132 is a small and reasonably attractive device that, like many home MFPs, is made from black plastic. Its price and specifications place it in competition with the Samsung SCX-3205W, but while that supports wireless networking, the LaserJet connects to only a single PC via USB.
I am extremely sorry to say this but the driver you have requested is not available for macOS 12. To fix this issue, you will need to Uninstall (remove) the currently installed printer and re-install it again using the built-in driver or the previous version of the driver (Version 10.15 Catalina or older).

Prints were quite rapid, with text or greyscale graphics both arriving at 16.5 pages per minute (ppm), and the results were good. Text was excellent quality, and while graphics were a touch dark they remained free of banding or obvious dither patterns – two common mono laser traits. The only hitch was a single blank page that snuck into the output after the paper feed failed to separate it from the page being printed.
This simple MFP has a basic paper input tray that projects from the front, exposing part of the paper stack to dust. It folds up neatly when not in use, but the output tray is formed with an extension that, once clipped on, can't be folded away. There's a very basic control panel, consisting of a two-digit LED display paired with up and down buttons. These adjust the quantity, exposure or magnification level of copies, depending on which of three nearby buttons is selected. The only other controls are copy and cancel buttons, and a power switch.
