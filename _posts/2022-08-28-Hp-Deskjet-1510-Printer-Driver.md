Hi Samiksa,Welcome to the HP Support Forums. I gather that you are trying to print from your iPad to your Deskjet 1510 printer.This printer does not support Apple’s AirPrint feature as it has no wireless capabilities. I have included the Deskjet 1510 Printer Specifications for your reference.
First and foremost, make sure you’ve properly removed the printer from its box with all included pieces for swift and organized assembly. It is easy to rush through the simplest part blinded by excitement and haste, and even easier to skip the most basic of steps.
If it still does not appear, an option under the “Refresh” button should appear that reads “The printer that I want isn’t listed.” Windows’ integrated troubleshooting guide will take over and search for available linked printers. Once located, Windows will provide the corresponding driver for you to download to complete the installation.
Right-click or tap and hold the lower left corner of the screen to open the menu, click or tap Control Panel, click or tap Devices and Printers, double-click or double-tap the name of your HP printer, and then click HP Print Assistant to open the HP printer software.

HP Deskjet 1510 Driver – The HP Deskjet 1510 is a small, neat, white unit – very inconspicuous when not used. Uncommonly for an HP inkjet, a paper-feed tray folds up from the printer’s top; the machine feeds from the back instead of the front. The tray is black, approving web pages from A4 to 15 x 10cm instead of the remainder of the body.
HP Deskjet 1510 Driver – The color publishes quality experiences regarding the vibrancy, and we have found some of the publish outs are marked with scrapes from the paper feed rollers. The Deskjet 1510 will be enough for laid-back picture prints, but we would not suggest it for pictures you want to maintain.
