Brother printer driver is an application software program that works on a computer to communicate with a printer. When a print command from a computer is sent to the printer, “Printer Driver” acts like an intermediary and converts information from this program into a language format that can be understood by the printer and operating system that is used on certain computers such as Windows XP, 7, Windows 10. This is important enough to use suitable drivers to avoid problems when printing.
3) Click the Update button next to a flagged printer driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

brother rates the HL-2240 at 24 web pages per minute (ppm). More vital, the printer quickly measures up to the promise of its score. I checked it on a Windows Vista system. Also, I timed it at a total amount of 6 minutes 31 secs on our service applications collection (using QualityLogic’s hardware and software for timing). That’s an obvious improvement on the HL-2170W, which took 7:30, tied with, or simply a touch quicker than, a lot more pricey Editors’ Choice Brother HL-5340D ($200 road, 4.5 celebrities), at 6:47.
Note that the HL-2240 doesn't offer duplex printing, so, if you want to print on both sides of a piece of paper, you have to manually turn the sheet over and place it back in the paper tray. This model also lacks both Ethernet and Wi-Fi support, so it can only be connected to your computer via USB.
