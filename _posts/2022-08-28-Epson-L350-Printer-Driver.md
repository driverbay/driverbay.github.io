In Jan 2003 I bought VueScan for my Epson Perfection 1200. I used it a lot, more functions than the standard driver. Got new computers with new operating systems, forgot about VueScan. I got a new Epson scanner - old one doesn't have Win10 drivers. I remembered VueScan. Found it, downloaded the trial version, and my old EPSON 1200 scanner WORKED again. Wow, a purchase made in 2003, works on a PC with an operating system that doesn't exist in 2003. 17 YEARS later! And that for a very small amount of money. THIS IS SERVICE AND ADDING VALUE TO YOUR CUSTOMER!
