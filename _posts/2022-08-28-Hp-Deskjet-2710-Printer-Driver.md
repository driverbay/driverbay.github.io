hey, first of all: sorry for my English, I am a not a native English speaker! I have the following problem, two weeks ago I set up my new printer (HP Deskjet 2710) and the setup via the HP Smart App on my android phone was pretty quick and easy and everything worked really well. (wifi,wifidirect) NOW two weeks later, the printer doesn't have a wifi connection anymore and also it is impossible, to reconnect it , because it says that my wifi password is incorrect (which is untrue and the wifi is working well on all other devices) and also that I can't set up the printer with a mobile device anymore (which is weird, because it worked before). I also cannot set up the printer with my computer, because I have an acer chromebook and it just doesn't have the software for it to properly work, the printer shows up for connection but then nothing happens. Also the local network with the printer is sometimes working and sometimes not. I would be unbelievably happy if someone could help me!!!!!
Hi, thank you for your links. That gave a lot more clarity and we made it happen to print.Nonetheless, its not really an enjoyable, reliable and intuitive experience to print with the phone, because we phase some problems:The HP Smart App does not work for the android phone. The printing seems to work sometimes (when we have started printer and initiated the connection), but then after the first print job, it does not allow to print anymore.Disconnecting and connecting again helps the issue sometimes, but not always.Have you had some experience with this and can give some advice?Thanks beforehand and best regards,StefanStarting it all again usually works, but not all the time
On the other hand, if the sky’s the limit pricewise and you demand a legal-size scanned plus two-sided printing, the HP OfficeJet 7410 All-in-One appears. However, for a small wireless workplace or a home connection with limited work desk space, the HP 2710 may be perfect.
HP was recently made aware of a vulnerability in certain InkJet and LaserJet printers by a third-party researcher. HP has updates available for download to address the vulnerability. Details and more information are available in the Security Bulletin.

@claudia1212, Welcome to the HP Support Community!Your English is great. I believe you are using a Deskjet 2710 printer. I understand you are not able to connect the printer to the wireless network.Restart the wireless router, the printer, and the PhoneMake sure the printer and the Phone are connected to the same wireless network. Either 2.4 or 5GHz network.If you have a Dual-band router and both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks share the same name/SSID, the printer will not be able to connect to the network. In this case, contact your Internet service provider to assign different names to both the networks.If not connected, use the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) button on your router to connect the printer to your wireless network.Place the printer near the Wi-Fi router.Make sure paper is loaded in the main tray, and then turn on the printer.On the printer control panel, press and hold the Wireless button for at least 5 seconds or until the light starts blinking. For Tango printers, press and hold the Wireless and Power buttons on the rear of the printer until the blue bar flashes.Within two minutes, press and hold the WPS button on the router until the connection process begins.Wait for the light on the printer to stop blinking.Try printing from your phone.Hope this helps!

HP DeskJet 2710 Driver – Unlike all-in-ones that are driven more towards home users, such as the Lexmark P6250 and the Epson Stylus CX6600, the HP 2710 has standalone fax capabilities–handy for faxing without switching on your PC; it comes with a numerical keypad, a telephone cable, and jacks, plus complete faxing software.
